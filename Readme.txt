This is a code sample project I did a while back to use for resume submissions and stuff. I thought I'd post it up.
It is basically a small game where there is a green zombie going around killing blue civilians. You move around a
bomb with your mouse and try to blow up the zombie. The game demonstrates a game loop and state machine.

This project needs the GLUT library to run which you will have to download and install from here

Zombie Invasion

In Zombie your job is to save the civilians from the mindless zombie hordes that have attacked the city. 
To do this you come armed with plenty of trusty bombs. Luckily you have body armor to protect you from the 
bombs but the civilians do not so be carefull not to blow them up too!

In the game the zombies are the green dots where as the civilians are the blue dots. Our hero is the majestic 
red hexagon. You move him around by clicking on the screen where you want to go, and you fire your bomb by 
right clicking.
