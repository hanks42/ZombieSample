Zombie Invasion

In Zombie your job is to save the civilians from the mindless zombie hordes that have attacked the city. To do this you come armed with plenty of trusty bombs. Luckily you have body armor to protect you from the bombs but the civilians do not so be carefull not to blow them up too!

In the game the zombies are the green dots where as the civilians are the blue dots. Our hero is the majestic red hexagon. You move him around by clicking on the screen where you want to go, and you fire your bomb by right clicking.
